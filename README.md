# TAROTJS

## About

This project stems from a few different aspirations and interestests... I've been interested in coding the mechanics of a deck of cards using javascript for a while now; ever since I found out about [SuperTry Studios](https://supertry.itch.io/)' table top game "[Space Kings](https://supertry.itch.io/spacekings)," really. I was a backer on the Kickstarter and an avid listener of the podcast [Pretend Friends](https://pretendfriends.libsyn.com/). In an effort to find some code or tutorials that already accomplished the thing that I wanted to do, I came across Walter Guevara's website, "*That Software Dude*," where he had [an article](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript) talking about exactly what I was looking for; how to code a deck of cards in javascript.

Since I didn't want to just replicate and type the code that Guevara put together verbatim, I thought it would be interesting to use Tarot as a starting point, since it does share similarities with regular playing cards. Something similar to what I hope to accomplish does exist on [The Internet Sacred Text Archive](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/tarot0.htm), but it is fairly limited and was written almost a quarter of a century ago. Additionally, I really like the function that Guevara wrote for shuffling cards. Instead of just pulling random cards from a pool, his method actually sequences a shuffled deck. 

I have also seen projects using [E Kelen](https://github.com/ekelen)'s "[tarot-api](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api)," but it might be useful to expand on that work, or make something entirely self-contained.

The current version of the script includes a class that also plays out a psuedo game of War using the Tarot deck. This was implemented based on the week 6 Promineo Tech front-end coding bootcamp, which is a course that I am taking as of the writing of this README. When the assignment was proposed I thought it would be a good way to learn how to manipulate a deck of cards, specifically this digital Tarot deck.

## TODO

1. Implement some type of system for generating different spreads.
2. Incorporate text from the *The Pictorial Key to the Tarot* by A.E. Waite and/or from other public domain sources.
3. Display scans of the Tarot cards for various different spreads.
