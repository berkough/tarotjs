# TAROTJS

## About

This project stems from a few different aspirations and interestests... I've been interested in coding the mechanics of a deck of cards using javascript for a while now. In an effort to find some code or tutorials that already accomplished the thing that I wanted to do, I came across Walter Guevara's website, "*That Software Dude*, he has [an article](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript) talking about exactly what I was looking for; how to code a deck of cards in javascript.

Since I didn't just want to just replicate and type the code that Guevara put together verbatim, I thought it would be interesting to use Tarot instead, since it does share similarities with regular playing cards. [The Internet Sacred Text Archive](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/tarot0.htm) has a similar javascript spread, but it is fairly limited and was written almost a quarter of a century ago.

I have also seen projects using [E Kelen](https://github.com/ekelen)'s "[tarot-api](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api)," but it might be useful to expand on that work, or make something entirely self-contained.

Special thanks to [Luciella Elisabeth Scarlett](https://luciellaes.itch.io/rider-waite-smith-tarot-cards-cc0) for cleaning up the scans from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot).

## TODO

- Click and go through each card. With the meaning.
- "Floating" menu for selecting cards.
- Implement Reversals.
- Three Cards spread.
- Remember the last spreadâ€¦
- Implement Chat or another AI to provide interpretations for the cards.
